Abstract
------

The motivating issue that drove me to compare Mauritian literature and the public literary education system is my fascination at the fact that the school system is British while the majority of popular Mauritian literature is written in French, with a burgeoning subgroup of works written in Mauritian Kreol. I cannot explain the divide, and many Mauritian students do study French language and (limited) literature, but I seek to show that Mauritians should be interested in their own literature and that they should actively question their British education.
