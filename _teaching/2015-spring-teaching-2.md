Teaching College Writing Practicum - Fall 2022
------
In this class, led by Dr. Joanna Johnson, we learned about the pedagogy behind college writing classes and the question of balancing writing standards with tools that college students can use across a range of disciplines. Our final assignment was to create a mock syllabus with one month's worth of classes planned out and one of the assignment's explained.  



Teaching Literature Practicum - Spring 2023
------
This class, led by Dr. Brenna Munro, mixed pedagogical analysis of teaching literature to college students at varying academic levels, with mock practice lessons in which we planned exercises or classes around specific skills, such as close-reading, pacing literary readings, and questioning authorial intent and audience perception. Our final assignment was to create a syllabus on a topic of our choice, designed as a low-level literature course, with a reading list, annotated bibliography, and two assignments detailed after the syllubus.
