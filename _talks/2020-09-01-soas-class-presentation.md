Presentation for Literatures of South Asia class at SOAS
[Rewriting Pride and Prejudice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uf3EH_86Yc)

This presentation was scripted, filmed, and edited for Dr. David Lunn's SOAS 2019/2020 course on Literatures of South Asia. 

It is a short video that describes four adaptations of Jane Austen's *Pride and Prejudice* that came out between the Summer of 2018 and the Summer of 2019. All four were rewritten to focus on non-Western cultures, although three of the four were set in various places in the United States, within diasporic communities. Three of the four were focused on South Asian culture, one of which was set in Pakistan, the other two set in Canada and the US. 

Movavi Video Editing 14 was used to put this video together in its entirety. All the backgrounds, text styles, and sound effects come from this tool.
