Culture Chat with Sifu Mimi Chan
["Gareeboo Family on Ramadan and Others"](https://www.sifumimichan.com/ramadan)

My father and I were/are (respectively) students at the Wah Lum Kung Fu & Tai Chi School or Orlando, Florida. In 2018, Sifu Mimi Chan asked to interview us based off of our experiences as Muslims living in Orlando, FL. The interview was recorded and video-taped for her podcast and Youtube channel. 

Both my father and I are included in the same video and we detail our experiences growing up, in the United States, and praticing/explaining Ramadan.
