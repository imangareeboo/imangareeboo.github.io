This project aims at providing a single, comprehensive website cataloguing adaptations of Jane Austen's corpus across text, film, tv series, web series', fanfiction, online games, and more. The data on Austen adaptations is still being created for this website, so this project, using the Hitchens theme forked from Github, is a preliminary display for the final project. 

*Austen Adaptations* can be accessed [here.](https://imangareeboo.github.io/Austen_Adaptations/)<br>
The GitHub repo for this project can be accessed [here](https://github.com/imangareeboo/Austen_Adaptations)
